# PDF_NLP_PROJ


Here i have created 2 seperate file to resolve the issue

1. nltk_spacy --> Here i have used pypdf library to read pdf file and then tried to fetch pattern but while fetching PDf using PYPDF i was facing space issue and some time i got every world in new line and apart from these i am not able to make pattern more generic that's why i have created 2nd code which is completely based on pandas and pyspark libray

2. pdfttotextcon --> Here first i try to convert pdf file to csv  file  then i can easily read it as a dataframe so based on our key i can directy fetch data.

so i think 2nd option is the most optimized way to solve this issue
